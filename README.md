or get the APK from the [Releases Section](https://github.com/sspanak/tt9/releases/latest).

## System Requirements
- Android 4.4 or higher. _(Tested and confirmed on Android 4.4.2, 5.1.1 and 11)_
- Free space:
  - Minimum 15 Mb when not using Predictive mode and no dictionaries are loaded.
  - Plenty of space per each enabled language in Predictive mode (25-100 Mb, depending on the word count).
- A hardware keypad or a keyboard. The application is not usable on touchscreen-only devices.

_If you own a phone with Android 2.2 up to 4.4, please refer to the original version of Traditional T9 from 2016._

## How to use Traditional T9?
Before using Traditional T9 for the first time you would need to load a dictionary and configure it. After that, you could start typing right away in one of the three modes: Predictive, ABC or Numeric. And even if you have mastered the keypad back in the days, you would still find the Predictive mode now provides powerful and smart new ways of typing with even less key presses.

So make sure to read the initial setup and the hotkey tips in the [user manual](docs/user-manual.md).

## Contributing to the Project
As with many other open-source projects, this one is also maintained by its author in his free time. Any help in making Traditional T9 better will be highly appreciated. Here is what you could do:
- [Report bugs](https://github.com/sspanak/tt9/issues) or other unusual behavior on different phones. Currently, the only testing and development device is: Qin F21 Pro+ / Android 11.
- Add [a new language](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-language), [new UI translations](res/values/strings.xml) or simply fix a spelling mistake. If you have minimum techincal knowledge, your skills as a native speaker will be of great use. Or, if you are not tech-savvy, just [open a new issue](https://github.com/sspanak/tt9/issues) and write the correct translations there.
- Experienced developers who are willing fix a bug, or maybe create a brand new feature, see the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
