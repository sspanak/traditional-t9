# Traditional T9 Installation Guide

## Phones which allow installing APKs

### From F-Droid
The recommended way of installing is using F-droid. It will automatically manage downloads and keep TT9 up-to-date. The downside is new versions may become available as late as two weeks after the official release.

If you have F-droid, just search for "Traditional T9" and install it. If not, get the official F-droid APK from https://f-droid.org/ and follow the [installation instructions](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Get_F-Droid/).

### From Github
If you would like to run the latest version as soon as it is released, go to the Github [Releases section](https://github.com/sspanak/tt9/releases). Then either download the APK on your phone, or download it on a computer and transfer it to the phone. After that, just click or tap to install. If custom APK installation is enabled, it will just work. If not, your phone may show a popup, asking you to grant the installation permission, before proceeding.

In some cases, installation permissions are disabled by default, but you can usually enable them by going to: Android Settings → Apps → Settings → Security, then enable "Installation from unknown sources".

_The setting name or location may be different on different Android versions. Nevertheless, a quick Google search for your phone make and model, should point you in the right direction._
