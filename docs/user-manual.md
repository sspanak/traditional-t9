#### Back (↩):
- **Short Press when there is text:** Usually, "backspace". However, some applications, most notably Firefox and Spotify, forbid this action in their search fields. This is due to the fact Android allows applications to take over control of the physical keypad and redefine what buttons do. Unfortunately, nothing can be done in such cases, "Back" will function as the application authors intended, instead of as backspace.
- **Short Press when there is no text:** System default, no special action (usually, go back)
- **Long Press:** System default, no special action
