  This is the forth release of the Russian spellchecker dictionary.
  It consists of three parts, words of "General usage" (ru_gen4.dic),
  "Physics" (ru_phys4.dic) and "Proper names" (ru_names4.dic)
  wordlists. In comparison with the previous edition, prepared by Lev
  Melnikov, support of Russian letter "io" has been added in
  conformity with recommendations of the Ministry of Education and
  Science of the Russian Federation. The dictionary is provided AS IS
  without any warranty. Feel free to copy, use, distribute, abuse or
  delete this dictionary in any way you wish. I tried to verify it to
  my best, still if you find something that you believe is an error,
  please contact me.
