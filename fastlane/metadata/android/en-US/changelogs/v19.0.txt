##  Brazilian Portuguese, Hebrew and Norwegian
This release adds three new languages and improves slightly the Auto Space function. 

**NOTE:** If you are using a language different than English, your language preferences may be reset. There is nothing to worry about, you just need to go to the Settings and re-enable the language(s) you have been using (no need to reload the dictionaries).
